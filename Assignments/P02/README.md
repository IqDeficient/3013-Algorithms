### Instructions

- Download the files above (animals.json and the txt files are not necessary to running but could be used for alternate to dictionary.json, they are located in the data folder).
- Run the program ensuring headers and proper data are in proper paths then begin typing any word.
- If you wish to see the definition of the typed word and if there are other word options then hit = else if there are no other word options and just the one hit enter.
- The definition will show and from there you can either backspace to find another word or you can enter a capital Z and end the program.
